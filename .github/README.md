 Climate model for Earth Systems 2020/201


## Core concepts
### Radiative Balance
- Our models are written focusing on this primarily
- Incident solar radiation is near-constant
    - In our case, around 1370W m^{-2}
- E = σT^4
- At the balance point, you get T_{BB}
- T_{bb}=\sqrt{\frac{S}{4σ}} (needs 4th root)
- As earth doesn't absorb everything, 




## Ideas for additional processes
### Volcanism
- random (maybe seed-based)? frequency events of varying magnitude, release CO2+particulates
- particulates
### Dust
- betts 2008

### water vapour
"However, the amount of water vapour in the atmosphere is controlled mostly by air temperature, rather
than by emissions" AR5, 682
"With every extra degree of air temperature,
the atmosphere can retain around 7% more water
vapour"
kg m^2, 7% increase for 1c

### blackbody feedback


the rahmstorf guy did stuff like this - look at that?

## Finding params
feedbacks given in w m2 k 
0.02 w m2 k
can use climate sensitivity
1 degree warming -> 0.02w m2
4 wm2 -> 3c
1 wm2 -> 3/4 c

find 3.93 from ar6


## Climate sensitivity
- a double CO2 scenario leads to 3.0c warming (IPCC TS p68)
- a double CO2 scenario leads to 3.7 w m2 rfg (IPCC TS p68)
- thus 0.81 c warming per 1w rfan

1 degree temp increase leads to methane release, resulting in x amount of radiative forcing
x radiative forcing leads to x * 0.81c additional warming

1w change leads to 1/1.23 = 0.81 c change
