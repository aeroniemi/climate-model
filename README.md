 Climate model for Earth Systems 2020/201


## Core concepts
### Radiative Balance
- Our models are written focusing on this primarily
- Incident solar radiation is near-constant
    - In our case, around 1370W m^{-2}
- E = σT^4
- At the balance point, you get T_{BB}
- T_{bb}=\sqrt{\frac{S}{4σ}} (needs 4th root)
- As earth doesn't absorb everything,
